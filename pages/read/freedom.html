<h3>::: An honest definition</h3>

<p>
Freedom means the right to private property, to accumulate capital, hoard
wealth, and consequently exploit the working class for all the surplus value
their productive labor creates.
</p>

<p>
Freedom means the right to have ten political parties in parliament whose only
purpose is to provide the illusion of choice, the illusion of different
perspectives on social issues, while lobbyism and corruption run rampant, and is
an integral part of the electoral process, where enormous cartels and
conglomerates dictate policy for the sole interest of capital accumulation, with
your pathetic vote being sold to the highest bidder.
</p>

<p>
Freedom means the right to enslave third world countries, militarily and
economically, the right to set up sweatshops in Indonesia, Bangladesh, and
Pakistan with legal slaves and child laborers who will break their backs to turn
a profit for western corporations. It means the same old predatory practices of
colonialism and imperialism where settlers would have the right to genocide
native populations and keep slaves, just cloaked in more subtle forms, such as
debtors' prison and unequal exchange deals.
</p>

<p>
Freedom means the right of corporations and media conglomerates to
psychologically cripple the entire population, while stealing their data,
manipulating their attention, bombarding them with advertisements, flashy
reality shows, tasteless mumbling referred to as "music," and other elements of
"show business," causing depression and making them addicted to all sorts of
vices, digital and otherwise, quite ironically acting as a hivemind of faceless
drones, all the while preaching about "personal liberties."
</p>

<p>
Freedom means the right to shamelessly lie about and circumvent environmental
and ethical regulations, to greenwash old, predatory, and destructive practices
in the pursuit of profit.
</p>

<p>
Freedom means the right of media outlets to bombard the populus with fraudulent
news and conservative and liberal propaganda in the wake of tragic events, to
lie to them and cause mass hysteria with terrorism and fabricated threats, with
the goal of manipulating public opinion in favor of invading a third world
country, for example, or introducing mass surveillance for the sake of "national
security."
</p>

<p>
Freedom means the right of nazis and fascists to speak freely, so that they can
jump in and save the day in case capital becomes threatened by workers'
movements, or god forbid, a communist revolution.
</p>

<p>
Freedom means the banning of labor movements, the rolling back of social
benefits achieved through decades of class struggle as soon as there's no
imminent threat to their exploitative systems. Just like the steady removal of
social democratic safety nets and social benefits from western countries, as
soon as the ultimate threat, the Soviet Union, was out of the picture.
</p>

<p>
And for the average person, well, freedom means the right to indulge in hedonist
consumer culture, to become a slave to commodities, to fetishize their control
over our lives. It means the right to spend your entire day on social media with
your every move tracked with cookies, monitored over your camera and microphone,
and manipulated by the algorithm.
</p>

<p>
Freedom means the right to be greedy, self-interested, and ruthless in hopes
that you'll one day become part of the higher class, just after your sleepless
nights of self-exploitative grinding and hustling are stamped with that one
lucky break that's standing between you and success.
</p>

<p>
Freedom means the right to toil away in a faceless corporation in a mundane,
bullshit job in finance, stock trading, marketing, and similar corporate jobs
that offer no benefit for society while burning yourself out for the friendly
face of authority, and ironically, serving as a cog in a cold, monstrous
machine, alienated from your labor, your environment, and your own existence.
</p>

<p>
Freedom means the right to be unemployed and homeless.
</p>

<p>
Freedom means union busting, being told, "Hey, you're being cocky with your
demands. Look at this entire army of desperate people who'd be ready to take
this job no matter the conditions or the pay."
</p>

<p>
Such is freedom.
