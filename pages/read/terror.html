<p>::: the two terrors</p>

<p>
there were two “reigns of terror,” if we would but remember it and consider it;
the one wrought murder in hot passion, the other in heartless cold blood; the
one lasted mere months, the other had lasted a thousand years; the one inflicted
death upon ten thousand persons, the other upon a hundred millions; but our
shudders are all for the “horrors” of the minor terror, the momentary terror, so
to speak; whereas, what is the horror of swift death by the axe, compared with
lifelong death from hunger, cold, insult, cruelty, and heart-break? what is
swift death by lightning compared with death by slow fire at the stake? a city
cemetery could contain the coffins filled by that brief terror which we have all
been so diligently taught to shiver at and mourn over; but all france could
hardly contain the coffins filled by that older and real terror -- that
unspeakably bitter and awful terror which none of us has been taught to see in
its vastness or pity as it deserves.
